# xLoader fork specifically made to flash a Woodpecker 2.6 board!
Microsoft Windows Tool for Flashing CC01, CR01, CR02 or CR03 using IP01

### Flashing Steps:
1. Disconnect high voltage power from your Woodpecker board, leaving **only** the 5v USB cable connected from the Woodpecker board to your computer. Disconnect all stepper motors, motor drivers, and spindle
2. Download this repository as a ZIP file via the green button above. This repo in particular containes the patched files needed to flash your Woodpecker board. Neither the current base version of xLoader, nor the old version of xLoader provided by Linksprite, work properly to flash the Woodpecker board, so using this forked repo is required for now.
3. Extract the contents
4. Drill down (heh, CNC pun?) into the directory and run the xLoader executable
5. (More to come shortly! If you need help before I update these instructions, please open an issue)
